## Instructions
Using Python, construct a class without importing any modules given the following guidelines:
* Given 2 inputs, data and shape, construct a tensor using nested lists.
* A tensor a general term for n* dimension matrix. (order goes scalar, vector, matrix, tensor)
* Data and shape inputs are given as lists of numbers. Data can be any number (int or float), but shape needs to be a list of positive integers.
* Data and shape inputs can be lists of any length.
* The constructed tensor can be saved as an instance variable, printed in standard output, or both.
* If too many data numbers, cut it off after the tensor fills up. If not enough, pad the tensor w/ zeroes.
* Output an empty list if the shape given is also an empty list ([])
